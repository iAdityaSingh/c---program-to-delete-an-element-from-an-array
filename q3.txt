WAP to delete an element from an array, use search algorithm to find the index number
of given number; if element to be deleted is not found then print “Error: element not
found”.
The program are as follows:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
int array[100], position, c, n;
cout << "Enter the number of elements of the array : ";
cin >> n;
cout << "Input the array elements : ";
for (c = 0; c < n; c++)
cin >> array[c];
cout << "Enter the position : ";
cin >> position;
if (position >= n+1)
cout << "\nError: element not found.\n";
else
{
for (c = position - 1; c < n - 1; c++)
array[c] = array[c+1];
cout<<"\nElement deleted successfully..!!\n";
cout<<"\nNow the new array is :\n";
for (c = 0; c < n - 1; c++)
cout << array[c] << " ";
}
cout << endl;
return 0;
}
